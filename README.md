## Overview

This project aims to perform various data analysis tasks on a dataset containing product information and reviews. The tasks range from basic data loading to advanced text processing and sentiment analysis.

## Task 1: Loading Data

Implemented `task1()` function in `task1.py` to output basic statistics about the dataset in JSON format.

## Task 2: Data Aggregation

Implemented `task2()` function in `task2.py` to calculate the average review score for each product and save the results to a CSV file.

## Task 3: Calculating the Average Product Price

Implemented `task3()` function in `task3.py` to calculate the average cost for each product and save the results to a CSV file.

## Task 4: Plotting the Average Review Score

Implemented `task4()` function in `task4.py` to generate a plot comparing the average price with the average review score for products in the 'Pet Supplies' category.

## Task 5: Comparing Review Scores Between Categories

Implemented `task5()` function in `task5.py` to output a plot comparing the means of the average review scores of products in each category.

## Task 6: Text Processing

Implemented `task6()` function in `task6.py` to preprocess review text and generate word bigrams for sentiment analysis, saving the results in a JSON file.

## Task 7: Detecting the Most Indicative Bigrams of Positive Reviews

Implemented `task7()` function in `task7.py` to calculate log odds ratios for bigrams and output relevant statistics and plots.

## Task 8: Analysis Report

Prepared a brief analysis report summarizing findings from tasks 4, 5, and 7, including interpretations of plots and insights into review sentiment and product characteristics. Report submitted as `task8.pdf`.
